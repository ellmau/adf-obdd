# Frontend for Webservice

This directory contains the (standalone) frontend for <https://adf-bdd.dev> built using React, Material UI and Typescript.

## Usage

For local development run:

- `yarn install` to install the dependencies
- `yarn run check` to run typechecks and the linter (eslint)
- `yarn start` to start the development server listening on `localhost:1234`

The frontend tries to connect to the server at `localhost:8080` in development mode.
